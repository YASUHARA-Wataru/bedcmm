# Open Implementation of Patented Algorithm (Japan Patent)
This repository provides an open implementation of the "Base Extraction Division Minimum Method," which is registered as a patent in Japan.

- This implementation is intended for research, verification, and evaluation purposes.
- Commercial use or redistribution requires obtaining a license (see below).

## Features
- Quantitative pattern extraction
- Quantitative periodicity calculation
- Quantitative continuity calculation
- Multiplexing communication using shorter sequences than M-sequences and only 1-bit quantization.However, synchronization is required, randomness is not guaranteed, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not improved.

## Demo
By running `example/pattern_demo.ipynb` and `example/communication_demo.ipynb`, you can obtain simple sample results:

## Patent Information
This algorithm is based on the following Japanese patent:

- Patent Number: JP Patent No. 7537807
- Title: Pattern Extraction and Communication Multiplexing Method
- Registration Date: August 13, 2024
- Summary: Methods for pattern extraction, periodicity calculation, continuity calculation, and communication multiplexing.
